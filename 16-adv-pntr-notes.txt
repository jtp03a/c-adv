Double Pointers - pointer to pointer
  When a pointer holds the memory address of another pointer
  a pointer points to a location in memory and thus used to store the address of variables
  with double pointer, the pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the location that contains the actual value
  Syntax
    place an additional astrix
    int **var;
    
    defrence
    int x = **var;
    
    Examples
    int a = 10;
    
    int *p1 = NULL;
    int **p2 = NULL;
    
    p1 = &a;
    p2 = &p1;
    
  Why? - Use cases
    Change the value of the pointer passed to a function as the function argument - simulates C++ pass by reference
      when you pass a pointer to a function it is a pass by copy of the pointer. The parameter point is pointing to the same thing but the pointer itself has a different address
      if you pass a single pointer as an arguement you will be modifying local copies of the pointer not the original pointer in the calling scope
      with pointer to a pointer you modify the original pointer
      use a double pointer as an argument to a function when you want to preserve the memory-allocation or assignment even outside of the function
