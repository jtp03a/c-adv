Can create own libraries
A library is just a group of code external to program that can be utilized
A collection of header files and implementation files exposed for use by other programs, interface expressed in a header file, implementation expressed in a c file.
can consist of one or more object files
C functions that can be shared by more than one app should be broken out and combiled and bundled in a library
programmer uses the interface file to figure out how to use a libary
Adv of library
  fast compile times
    have to compile all sources of your dependencies
  allows vendors a way to release an API to interface with an application
  modular development, separation of components
  software reuse
  version management
  
Linking
  When a C program is compiled the compiler generates obj code
  after gen obj code, compiler invokes linker
  linking is process of coleclting and combining mult obj files to create a single exe
  one linking task is to make the code of lib functions available to program
  linker can copy the code of lib func to obj code
  linker can make complete code of lib func available at runtime
  static linking is result of linker making copy of all used lib func to exe
  dynamic linking placing the name of the lib in the binary file, when program is run both bin and lib are in memory
  
  Static linking
    adv of speed
    client will always have the correct code
    larger binaries
    have to rebuild entire program
    more time consuming to fix bugs
    
  Dynamic linking
    libary loaded into memory by program on execution
    does not recompile the lib into the exe 
    likewise dont have to recompile program is new lib is released
    more modern approach
    smaller exe
    small runtime penalty/overhead
    saves disk and virtual mem
    all exes linked to a particular lib share a single copy of the lib
    improved efficiency
    
  Library Types
    Shared Objects
      dynamically linked
      code shared, data specific to each process
      aka dynamic libary
      *.so
    
    Static Libraries
      use static linking
      also known as archive
      *.a, *.lib
      each process gets its own copy of the code and data
      
      Id libraries from looking at the header files
