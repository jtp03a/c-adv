3 Forms of memeory 
  -static
    persistes through entire life of program
  -stack
    temporary variables
    usually variables inside of a function
    LIFO - last in first out data structure
    no need to manage
    limit on size - stack overflow
    divided into frames
    when func exits all of its variables are popped off the stack
    commom bug - acesss a variable that was created in a func
    use when
      dealing with small variables that only needed when a func is alive
  -heap
    hierarchical data structure
    not auto managed
    accessed through use of pointers
    have to explicitily allocate and deallocate the memory
    failure to free will result in memory leaks
    restriction on size is the physical size of memory
    variables created on heap are accessible anywhere in program
    use when
      allocate a large block of memory
      keep variable around a long time
      need variables that can change in size dynamically
