Storage Classes
  describe the scope, visibility, and life-time of a variable
  
  life-time - period variable exists in computer memory
  scope - where variable can be ref in program
  visibility - for multi-file programs desc how variable can be shared/seen between files 

C provides 4 storage classes
  auto
  register
  extern
  static

Auto Variables
  automatic storage duration
  local variables declared in func body or block of code
  all local var have auto storage dur by default
  auto created when func is called, val local to func
  val of local var can only be accessed by func in which it was defined
  C compiler assumes any var defined inside a func is a auto local var
  keyword auto seldom used
  
External Variables
  tells that var defined elsewhere - not whithin same block as used
  global var
  main purpose - vars can be access between two diff files
  ref to global var that is visible to all program files
  in general global vars are not good program design practice
  
  how to use:
    declare  and initialize a variable in a module outside any function (global)
    
    int num = 0;
    
    in another file file use extern keyword
    
    extern int num;
    
  extern functions can be defined
    can use func in another file without declaring in a header file
    
    put extern in front of function prototype to declar that the func is in another file
    
Static variables
